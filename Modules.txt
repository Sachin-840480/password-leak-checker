We are using the "Requests" Module to send sms to People.

    command :- "pip install requests"

    Link :- https://pypi.org/project/requests/

    This helps us to make requests using the network like a browser.

    This module allows us to download/ request html file, API's data like a actual web browser without using an actual window.
